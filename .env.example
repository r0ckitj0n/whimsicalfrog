# WhimsicalFrog example environment file
# Copy this file to ".env" (kept out of git) and fill values as needed.
# Notes:
# - PHP will load .env via config.php: loadEnv(__DIR__ . '/.env')
# - Vite reads env from the shell process (process.env.*) when building/serving
# - Do NOT commit your real .env; this example is safe to commit.

# --- Application environment ---
# WHF_ENV can force environment detection in PHP helpers (optional)
# Accepts: local | prod
#WHF_ENV=local

# --- Vite / Frontend Dev Server ---
# Port for Vite dev server (vite.config.js uses VITE_DEV_PORT or PORT)
VITE_DEV_PORT=5176
# Port for Vite HMR websocket (defaults to VITE_DEV_PORT)
VITE_HMR_PORT=5176
# Generic fallback port used by some tools
PORT=5176

# Force Vite dev asset injection from PHP helper regardless of hot file (optional)
#WF_VITE_DEV=0
# Disable dev/HMR even if hot file exists (optional)
#WF_VITE_DISABLE_DEV=0
# Explicit Vite origin (overrides hot file contents)
#WF_VITE_ORIGIN=http://localhost:5176

# Public base path when the site is served from a subdirectory (e.g., "/wf")
# Leave empty if served from the web root
#WF_PUBLIC_BASE=

# Backend origin injected for frontend code to call APIs with cookies
# If unset, vite_helper.php computes it from request headers
#WF_BACKEND_ORIGIN=http://localhost:8000

# --- Database (optional local overrides) ---
# The project typically reads local DB creds from config/my.cnf for CLI tools.
# You can place DB_* here if you prefer environment variables. Application
# code may need to be adjusted to read these instead of hardcoded values.
#DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
#DB_NAME=whimsicalfrog
#DB_USER=root
#DB_PASS=changeme
#DB_PORT=3306

# --- Third-party / APIs (document here; keep real keys only in local .env) ---
#ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=
#STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=
#SENTRY_DSN=
