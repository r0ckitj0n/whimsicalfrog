# WhimsicalFrog

Welcome to the WhimsicalFrog codebase! üéâ

All up-to-date documentation now lives in:

```
documentation/WHIMSICALFROG_FULL_DOCUMENTATION.md
```

That single document replaces the numerous legacy markdown files that previously described various subsystems. Those files have been archived for reference but should *not* be relied upon.

Quick links:
* [Full Documentation](documentation/WHIMSICALFROG_FULL_DOCUMENTATION.md)
* [Contribution Guide](documentation/WHIMSICALFROG_FULL_DOCUMENTATION.md#11-contribution-guide)
* [Local Development Setup](documentation/WHIMSICALFROG_FULL_DOCUMENTATION.md#4-local-development)

Enjoy coding! üê∏
