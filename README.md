# WhimsicalFrog

Welcome to the WhimsicalFrog codebase! üéâ

All up-to-date documentation now lives in:

```
documentation/WHIMSICALFROG_FULL_DOCUMENTATION.md
```

That single document replaces the numerous legacy markdown files that previously described various subsystems. Those files have been archived for reference but should *not* be relied upon.

Quick links:
* [Full Documentation](documentation/WHIMSICALFROG_FULL_DOCUMENTATION.md)
* [Contribution Guide](documentation/WHIMSICALFROG_FULL_DOCUMENTATION.md#11-contribution-guide)
* [Local Development Setup](documentation/WHIMSICALFROG_FULL_DOCUMENTATION.md#4-local-development)

## Front-end Quick Start (Vite)

```bash
# Install JS dependencies
npm install

# Start Vite dev server
npm run dev
```

The dev server runs on [http://localhost:5176](http://localhost:5176) and hot-reloads whenever you edit files under `js/`, `src/`, or `css/`.

To generate the production bundle used in `dist/`, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Full Stack Dev Servers (PHP + Vite)

To start both the PHP dev server (http://localhost:8080) and the Vite dev server (http://localhost:5176) together, run:

```bash
./scripts/restart_servers.sh
```

## Quick Commands (wf)

You can also use the `wf` helper for common operations:

```bash
# Start servers with monitoring
./wf start

# Check status
./wf status

# View recent logs
./wf logs

# Stop servers and monitor
./wf stop
```

The `wf` wrapper uses the scripts under `scripts/` and keeps process names consistent.

Enjoy coding! üê∏

## Environment (.env)

- See `.env.example` at the repo root for a template of expected variables.
- PHP loads environment variables from a root `.env` via `config.php` using `loadEnv(__DIR__ . '/.env')`.
- The actual `.env` file is git-ignored; copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill values locally.
- Vite/dev server reads values from the shell process (e.g., `VITE_DEV_PORT`, `VITE_HMR_PORT`, `PORT`). Optional toggles read by PHP include `WF_VITE_DEV`, `WF_VITE_DISABLE_DEV`, `WF_VITE_ORIGIN`, `WF_PUBLIC_BASE`, `WF_BACKEND_ORIGIN`.
