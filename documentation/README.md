# WhimsicalFrog Documentation

This README serves as a consolidated entry point for project documentation. It reflects the current configuration after admin tooling and routing cleanup.

## Table of Contents
- [Admin Guide (Current Configuration)](./ADMIN_GUIDE.md)
- [Room Function Centralization Summary](./CENTRALIZATION_SUMMARY.md)
- [Modal Conventions & Upgrade Guide](./Modal_Conventions_and_Upgrade_Guide.md)
- [Frontend CSS Reorg Plan](./frontend/css-reorg-plan.md)
- [Database Helper Adoption Guide](./includes/db-helper-adoption.md)

## Notes
- Older docs referencing `/admin/admin.php?section=...` have been updated to the clean route `/admin/?section=...`.
- Some historical files are retained for context but the Admin Guide reflects the canonical, current setup.
