# WhimsicalFrog Documentation

This README serves as a consolidated entry point for project documentation. It reflects the current configuration after admin tooling and routing cleanup.

Other deep technical docs may remain under `documentation/` for reference; prefer the Admin Guide for current behavior and routes.

## Notes
- Older docs referencing `/admin/admin.php?section=...` have been updated to the clean route `/admin/?section=...`.
- Some historical files are retained for context but the Admin Guide reflects the canonical, current setup.
