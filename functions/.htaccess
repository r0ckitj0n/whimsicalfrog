# Security hardening for the /functions directory
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 1. Disable directory listing so visitors cannot browse file structure.
Options -Indexes

# 2. Protect this very file from outside access.
<Files .htaccess>
  Require all denied
</Files>

# 3. Block access to common sensitive file types
<FilesMatch "\.(?:bak|config|sql|fla|psd|ini|log|sh|inc|swp|dist|md|json|yml?|env)$">
  Require all denied
</FilesMatch>

# 4. Functions directory contains admin processing scripts
#    These should have their own authentication checks
#    Allow access but rely on PHP-level authentication

# End /functions/.htaccess
