# Security hardening for the /includes directory
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 1. Disable directory listing so visitors cannot browse file structure.
Options -Indexes

# 2. Protect this very file from outside access.
<Files .htaccess>
  Require all denied
</Files>

# 3. Block direct access to all PHP files in includes directory
#    These files should only be included by other scripts, not accessed directly
<FilesMatch "\.php$">
  Require all denied
</FilesMatch>

# 4. Block access to common sensitive file types
<FilesMatch "\.(?:bak|config|sql|fla|psd|ini|log|sh|inc|swp|dist|md|json|yml?|env)$">
  Require all denied
</FilesMatch>

# End /includes/.htaccess
