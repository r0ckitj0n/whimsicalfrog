# WhimsicalFrog - Replit Setup

## Project Overview
WhimsicalFrog is a PHP-based web application with a modern frontend built using Vite for asset management. The application has been successfully configured to run in the Replit environment.

## Current Setup
- **Application Type**: PHP web application with Vite frontend
- **Frontend Port**: 5000 (PHP server serving the main application)  
- **Asset Management**: Vite for JavaScript and CSS bundling
- **Database**: Not currently configured (uses MySQL/MariaDB in production)

## Architecture
- **Backend**: PHP 8.2.23 with built-in development server
- **Frontend**: Vite-managed JavaScript/CSS assets
- **Routing**: Custom PHP router (router.php) with clean URL support
- **Session Management**: PHP sessions with security configurations

## Key Configuration Changes for Replit
1. **Vite Configuration**: Modified to use port 5000 and host 0.0.0.0 for Replit compatibility
2. **Package.json**: Updated dev script to use correct ports and host settings
3. **Workflow**: Configured to run PHP server directly on port 5000
4. **Deployment**: Set up for autoscale deployment with proper PHP server command

## Development Workflow
The application runs using a single PHP server on port 5000 that:
- Serves the main application through router.php
- Handles clean URLs and routing
- Serves static assets (images, built CSS/JS)
- Manages sessions and authentication

## File Structure
- `index.php`: Main application entry point
- `router.php`: Development server router with asset handling
- `src/`: Frontend JavaScript and CSS source files
- `dist/`: Built assets (generated by Vite)
- `api/`: Backend API endpoints
- `includes/`: PHP includes and utilities
- `images/`: Static image assets

## Recent Changes (2025-09-24)
- Configured for Replit environment
- Set up PHP server to run on 0.0.0.0:5000
- Modified Vite configuration for compatibility
- Created deployment configuration for autoscale
- Verified application functionality and asset loading

## User Preferences
- Development server configured for Replit environment
- Single workflow approach (PHP-only, no separate Vite process needed in production)
- Clean URL routing with .htaccess fallbacks
